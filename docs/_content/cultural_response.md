# Culturual response

It is evident through means of common media, the news cycle and word of mouth that the collective reaction to school shootings has changed over time. Today, it is not uncommon this subject area is treated with a dose of dark humour. This does not come as a surprise, as it is simply human nature to devalue a repetitive stimilus - observed in this case as the diminishing of the shock value of the deaths of children in "safe" schools.

## Google search trends for school shootings

An example of this behavior is the frequency of Google searches for the keywords "school shooting" over the past years. While Google does not provide exact search numbers, the relative proportions allow a reasonable conclusion on the popularity of the search term. 

The four largest-impact school shootings to date are
 * `Columbine High School`, April 1999 - commonly regarded to as the first mass school shooting (which by FBI definition, it is not - ["Columbine Wasn't The First Mass School Shooting", *Bustle*](https://www.bustle.com/articles/141151-was-columbine-the-first-school-shooting-in-the-united-states-sue-klebold-finally-speaks-out-on)) with a casualty count of 34 (`13 deaths`).
 * `Sandy Hook Elementary School`, December 2012 - 28 casualties with `26 deaths`.
 * `Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School`, February 2018 - 34 casualties with `17 deaths`.
 * `Robb Elementary School`, May 2022 - 33 casualties with `21 deaths`.

While the Columbine shooting is out of scope for Google trends, it provides additional context for the other three events.

A reasonable first impression is the sudden rise of searches around the date of each occurence with upticks around dates of anniversaries for previous events.

Yet, a more concerning observation is the drop in relative interest for each next shooting. Understandably, Sandy Hook was a massive shock worldwide as one of the first mass school shootings of the decade following a relatively peaceful time period after the Columbine shooting (not depicted). The next occurence, Marjory High, noticed a drop in Google search popularity, despite a larger number of casualties (altough less deaths). The popularity for the search term after the Robb Elementary event, four years later, would notice that same drop twofold.

The could be explained by a more mature news cycle forming around the school shooting phenomenon, where more platforms are either willing or have the tools to provide the news, thereby removing the need to manually search for information. A news machine like the one assumed here requires the subject area to be just as evolved, thus providing the argument for its cyclical existence - the more popular something becomes, the more standardized and normalized it becomes.

## The romanticization of the antagonist

The danger of the normalization of this phenomenon and the wide-spread increase of tolerance provide a feedback loop pushing mentally unstable or disturbed individuals to persue this path as a viable means to achieve revenge on bully culture or simply a twisted sense of greatness or strength. The investigation of school shooting reasons is a subject for another report, but it would be out of place not to mention [the contagion effect](https://www.colorado.edu/today/2022/05/31/after-mass-shooting-examining-role-media-coverage) and an example of a perpetrator's perspective.

Nikolas Cruz, the criminal behind the Douglas High School shooting (2018), was found to have recorded and shared his thought process months before the event. From *CBS Miami's* newsreel ["Chilling Cell Phone Videos Made By Nikolas Cruz Released"](https://youtu.be/1UJ5-rSb3o0) a few key quotes of Nikolas - `"When you see me on the news you will all know who I am"` and `"My name is Nick and I am going to be the next school shooter of 2018"`.


## School shooting in media

Although not the focus of this report, a few examples of school shootings in media are provided to depict the prevelance of this culturual phenomenon.

* ["Evan"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8syQeFtBKc) and ["Back to school essentials"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=turCfxwkfPE) by the *Sandy Hook Promise* - awareness videos created by the nonprofit organization working for gun violence prevention programs and policies.

 * "Dead Kids", *South Park* - The protagonist school students are more concerned with failing a math quiz than ongoing school shooting threats. A student's parent's emotional response to school shootings is seen as abnormal by the community ([Wikipedia overview](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Kids_(South_Park))). This satirical piece comments on the cultural acceptance of school shootings.

 * ["thoughts & prayers", *grandson*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OZ7EasWwy0) - a musical piece released in 2018 on the subject matter. The title refers to the phrase "thoughts and prayers" commonly used as the only reaction to school shootings by those with the power to actually address the issue.

## Counter strategies

The American response to address the issue has been predominantly reactive, spawning a market around the concept of *campus safety*. An industry of "fire-fight-fire", pushing to make metal detectors, bulletproof doors and armed security normal at schools.

The *Washington Post* article ["Armored school doors, bulletproof whiteboards and secret snipers"](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/local/school-shootings-and-campus-safety-industry/) does a great job of detailing the absurdities, which among others detail a subscription-based, parent-sponsored militaristic infiltration programme based on the premise that an ex-special ops unit goes undercover to identify, befriend and neutralize potential shooters before they strike.

The introduction of resource officers also begs the question as to whether that is the appropriate response. Not only have they been shown to fail to prevent a shooting, they themselves can contribute to the problem. In the data set, out of seven cases where the shooter was established to be the resource officer, one was lethal - the officer responded to a student threatening him with a baseball bat by ending his life with a pistol (["Officer kills Fresno student"](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2008-apr-17-me-fresno17-story.html), *Los Angeles Times*). If not a failure in descalation, it is certainly a failure in an appropriate response.
