# Final thoughts

There is no denying that school shootings are a problem in America, though it is unclear if their magnitude has only increased due to the spotlight, pushing relatively low-impact shootings to be included in the discourse, or if the issue is now out of control.

The latter appears to be more accurate with near inaction from the government, the creation of a profitable industry focused on reactive measures, the cyclical fatum induced by Pandora's Box with shooters inspired by their predecessors and, perhaps the most damning, the commonization of the phenomenon leading to its devaluation and a drop in its importance.

It appears that the shootings have become a tolerated, lesser evil, that which is more acceptable than the alternative immediate approach of strict gun control. A decisive action which may prove to be largely unpopular and so unattractive in a short-term government cycle based on popularity. Concerningly, addressing the root cause of the shootings - which could be mental insecurity or proper violence education - is left to nonprofit organizations whose commitment may waver to the whim of the wind.

The keen reader may have noticed that the shooters have not been named. This is not a story about them. Their deeds, however heinous, do not validate their claim to fame and a twisted sense of glory. This is a story of the American system failing their youth. And this failure is now forever etched into history through statistics as true as the graves of the victims.
