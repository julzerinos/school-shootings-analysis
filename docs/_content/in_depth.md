# Shootings, not statistics

While discussing these shooting events it is easy to abstract the observations to simple numbers, comfortably ignoring the realization that these are factual events - of pain, of anguish and of death.

To hopefully illustrate this, this section will provide information more information on individual shootings, as well as the victims and perpetrators.

## The magnitude of the issue

The previously discussed graph on shooting occurrences is expanded to show casualties per year.

{% include shootings_details.html %}

The four infamous mass shooting death counts are clearly visible in the years 1999, 2012, 2018 and 2022. Disregarding the mass shootings, the death count appears to be maintained as a constant ratio of all casualties.

Details on all of the individual shootings to displayed on the map below. The size of each circle indicates the relative number of casualties at the occurrence. More information about the school and shooting can be identified by selecting a specific occurrence.

## Who are the shooters

This small subsection is devoted to looking at the range of the individuals who have been identified as shooters in the data set. It is worth remembering, not all of them are criminally intent. There were `45` such cases, with the shooting defined as accidental (an example of this is a loaded gun firing in a 12 year old's back pack, injuring five - ["Sal Castro Middle School Shooting: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know"](https://heavy.com/news/2018/02/sal-castro-los-angeles-middle-school-shooting/), *heavy*).

The image of the typical school shooter is strongly influenced by the four mass shootings - young, white teenagers who are (or very recently have been) students at the school. This notion is somewhat reinforced by the data set.

There appears to be a normal distribution of age around the mean of 15. The vast majority of shooters are male with a majority of white ethnicity.

**Where are they now**

Out of all the incidents, `33` are confirmed suicides. Such was the fate of the Columbine shooter, after they had taken 13 lives themselves. Another example is the shooter behind the Jacksonville Episcopal School, a former teacher who took the life of the school director and his own, the same day their work was terminated (["Head of Jacksonville Episcopal School killed in murder-suicide"](https://www.episcopalnewsservice.org/2012/03/06/head-of-jacksonville-episcopal-school-killed-in-murder-suicide/), *Episcopal News Service*).

Others are churned through the justice system, such as the Stoneman Douglas High School shooter, who was provided a sentence *four* years after the shooting (["At an emotional hearing, the Parkland shooter is formally sentenced to life in prison"](https://www.npr.org/2022/11/02/1133562604/parkland-shooter-life-sentence)).
