# Time trends

To attempt to understand which periods of time pose the greatest risk to school students, a look into the trends of hours, weekdays and months are made.

### Hourly

The first aggregation to understand is the pattern behind shooting frequency is by hour. This provides a glance into understanding which parts of the day are most potentially dangerous to students.

A note is made on the poor quality of recording on the hour of the shooting with varying time formats used and `20` empty values.

        style="overflow: hidden; border: transparent;"

School shootings do not occur outside of school hours (7am - 5pm), with the one exception of a recorded school shooting at 11pm which given the poor quality of time recording may be a mistake (11am).

Though the time of a shootings appears to be more or less evenly distributed over the hours of the day, there is an apparent seperation of high risk time periods - the first in the morning, as lessons are starting (8am), and the second, more potent, is during lunch hours (12pm) and thereafter.

### Weekdays

The same analysis is continued for weekdays aggregation.

<div style="width: 100%;">

        class="ioda"
        width="100%" height="370px" 
        src="assets/htmls/shootings_weekday.html"
        style="overflow: hidden; border: transparent;"
        >
    </iframe>
</div>

It appears that Tuesdays were most commonly plagued with shootings, with a stronger drop towards the end of the week (Thursday, Friday). 

Unsurprisingly, no shootings occured on weekends. 

### Months

Finally, months of the year are observed for patterns.

<div style="width: 100%;">
    <iframe 
        class="ioda"
        width="100%" height="370px" 
        src="assets/htmls/shootings_month.html"
        style="overflow: hidden; border: transparent;"
        >

</div>

The summer period observes less violence than the other parts of the year, but it is important to note that is due to the relative number of students being much lower (while summer schools are open).

A disheartening observation is the twofold increase in shootings from December to January, which is also when the most shootings occured in the entire year (at `51`).

In other parts of the year, the events are more or less evenly distributed around a trend of `40` per month.

## Take-away

While some of the observations seem obvious, while others troubling, it is important to keep in mind that indiscriminate shooters will likely want to maximize damage, thus choosing more effective periods of time to strike (eg. lunch period).

The Christmas period at the end of December may be an especially difficult period of time for individuals from broken homes and those struggling with mental illnesses alone, which might be a fuse for the increased activity at the beginning of the new year.

While these observations may provide insight into when increased care should be taken for risk of a shooting occuring, a criminal with intent will likely adjust their actions to account for these measures.
