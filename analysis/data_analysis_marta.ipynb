    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Below notebook contain all the analysis done on Washington Post dataset about the school shootings in US (link: https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-school-shootings).\n",
    "As the size of the dataset is quite small, most of the analysis were conducted using filtering in Excel. Here the main motivation and basic analysis will be presented together with final vizualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "While looking for an interesting dataset that would contain information from some limited region, we started to wonder what would be interesting for us.\n",
    "Datasets from the US are one of the most common to use, as they cover quite big areas as well as they have multiple entries.\n",
    "The problem with school shooting that the US has been struggling for the last couple of years seemed very interesting, as this phenomenon is observed only there.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of our analysis is to determine if there are any time patterns that could help prevent further tradegies.\n",
    "Furthermore, we will investigate cultural response and news trends. We will also look into different counterstategies that should prevent further accidents.\n",
    "Based on data analysis we want to determine how effective are they.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to draw attention to this problem, as it seems that it has partly dissappeared from social media, which does not mean that the number of accidents has dropped.\n",
    "We want to show that the problem is not gone and that despite intuition, the threat comes from pupils, not adults.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Our dataset contain information about the shootings that happened in schools. It starts with the first big massive school shooting in Columbine High School and includes data up to 2023.\n",
    "It contains data regarding date and time of schooting as well as some characteristics about the shooter as his age, gender, source of weapon etc.\n",
    "We also used the dataset from RAND about the gun ownership in the US. We wanted to examine if there is any connection between the number of weapons per household and the number of shootings in the area."
