    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains all the analysis done on Washington Post data set about school shootings in the US (link: https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-school-shootings).\n",
    "As the size of the data set is quite small, most of the preliminary analysis was conducted in Excel. Here the main motivation and basic analysis will be presented together with the source code for the final vizualizations used in the narrative piece [\"Exploration into two decades of school shootings in the United States\"](https://julzerinos.github.io/school-shootings-analysis/) hosted on Github Pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "While looking for an interesting data set that would contain information from a limited region, we started to wonder what would be more interesting for us.\n",
    "Data sets from the US are one of the most common to use, as they cover quite big areas as well as having a robust structure.\n",
    "The US has been struggling with school shootings for the last couple of years, which seemed an interesting case study, as this phenomenon is observed in the vast majority only there.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of our analysis is to determine if there are any time patterns that could help prevent further tradegies.\n",
    "Furthermore, we will investigate cultural response and news trends. We will also look into different counterstategies that should prevent further accidents.\n",
    "Based on data analysis we want to determine how effective are they.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to draw attention to this problem, as it seems that it has partly dissappeared from social media, which does not mean that the number of accidents has dropped.\n",
    "We want to show that the problem is not gone and that despite intuition, the threat comes from pupils, not adults.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Our dataset contain information about the shootings that happened in schools. It starts with the first big massive school shooting in Columbine High School and includes data up to 2023.\n",
    "It contains data regarding date and time of schooting as well as some characteristics about the shooter as his age, gender, source of weapon etc.\n",
    "We also used the dataset from RAND about the gun ownership in the US. We wanted to examine if there is any connection between the number of weapons per household and the number of shootings in the area."

    "\n",
    "Each entry in our dataset is a tragic event that should not have happen in a modern world, therefore it is really hard to generalize things and apply statistical models.\n",
    "Nonetheless, we will try to look for some patterns as well as connections between this accidents and other environmental factors. \n",

    "There are multiple aspects that could be taken into account while preparing this analysis, but we needed to focus on only some of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we would also like to investigate is the characteristic of victims - how old they are, what is their ethnic group, what relation do they have with the shooter.\n",
    "There are many interesting questions that can be asked to better understand what is the real cause of school shootings phenomenon.\n",
    "\n",
    "We wanted to include the analysis that could prove whether easier access to the weapon increases number of incidents. We partly did it with our visualization of gun ownership per household, but we do believe that in this topic there are more details that could be taken into account as f.x. availability of weapons due to legal regulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, the data set turned out to be slightly out of shape - especially with a lack of discipline in consistent feature formats. Another issue, while out of control of the authors (likely due to inaccessible historical data), many fields were left empty barring us from investigating features such as source of weapon, shooters details or victim details more thoroughly. Next time we would aim to expand our data sets by adding, possibly merging other sources as well to use as cross-reference and a more robust source of knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "A final, harsh truth we had to come to terms while working on the story is that there are no definitive answers. While we can with good intentions provide insight into the trends, the solution to this problem lies far beyond our capabilities with managing the American cultural sphere to suggest any meaningful fixes. It has become clear during our investigations that this is a burning thorn at the side of all Americans, but it is yet another societal catch-22 that would require a massive undertaking to uproot. \n",
    "\n",
    "What this means in terms for future improvement is to quickly realize concrete goals of the analysis and scale them appropriately to the tools and skills of the team. We set out to fix the world, but realized mid-way we could only reiterate our dismay with what reality is."
